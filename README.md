## Friend Finder

Friend Finder is a 'facebook-lite' application that allows users to find other people with simmilar interests based on a series of questions that the user provides answers for. It is operated by Node, Express, as well as varous GET and POST methods and APIs.

### Functionality

The functionality of this application is fairly straightforward. It opens up to a basic homepage that allows users to select an option that directs the user to a survey page. The survey page includes ten dropdown-style questions. Once the survey is submittted, the user's total score is compared with other people's total scores and a modal is shown with the person with your highest compatibility (the person with the closest total score). If the form is not completed appropriately, the user will be notified.
